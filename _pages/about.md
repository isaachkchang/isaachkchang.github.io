Neuroscience PhD student at [the University of California, San Francisco](https://neurograd.ucsf.edu/about-neuroscience-graduate-program).

Hi! My name is Isaac, and I research how neural circuits govern motor behavior.

I'm currently a fifth-year Neuroscience PhD student in the Neuroscience Graduate program at UCSF, working with [Prof. Jeanne Paz at the Gladstone Institutes](https://labs.gladstone.org/paz/) on pathways connecting the basal ganglia and the thalamus. Before UCSF, I worked with [Prof. Savio Chan at Northwestern University](https://www.saviochanlab.org/) on the dissection of different cell types in the external globus pallidus.
